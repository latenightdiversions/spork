An encrypted messaging client. It is basically a wrapper for GPG gone horribly wrong.

Specifically, the one no one asked for, wanted, needed, or deserved. But the one they're getting regardless.

This is the most horribly hardcoded and specific program that nobody should attempt to use. This should legally be classified as destruction of property due to the abuse of the very foundation and ideals set forth by the developers of the C++ language. The only reason one should even be on this github page is to mock its existance. However, assuming this project reaches completion, it will function perfectly in our exact situation.

Consider yourself warned.

Written in C++ because we don't know Java.
